<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This sandwich mixes the goodness of bagels with the crunch of dill pickles. I came up with this sandwich for my son who loves bagels and cream cheese but I felt his favorite needed something extra to really make it a lunch. This is kid-tested good, and you can alter the veggies according to what your child likes. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon herb and garlic flavored cream cheese </li>
<li>1 multigrain bagel, split and toasted </li>
<li>2 thin slices Cheddar cheese</li>
<li>2 slices dill pickle</li>
<li>1/4 cup shredded carrot</li>
<li>1 leaf lettuce</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Spread the cream cheese on the toasted bagel. Layer the Cheddar cheese, pickle slices, carrot, and lettuce onto one half of the bagel, then top with the remaining bagel half. Cut the sandwich in half and wrap with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the sandwich in a lunch bag with an ice pack.
